##### Lightness

##### Color Warmness
: ...

##### Colder color / Warmer color
: ...

##### Color Schema
: ...

##### Color Schemas

- Monochrome Color Schema
- Analogous Color Schema
- Complementary Color Schema
- Triadic Color Schema

##### Positive Space / Negative Space
: ...

##### Sedate / Alert / Dynamic angles

##### Composition: Contrast

- Textured / Smoothed
- Size
- Direction
- Shape
- Proximity
- Color Hue
- Color Value ~ Color Lightness
- Color Warmness
- Detail
- Softness
- Thickness
- Focus ~ Edge Quality ( Blurred or Focused )

##### Composition: Structure

- Golden Ration
- The Rule of Thirds
- Full Frame
- Composition Type

##### Composition: Types

- Circle : focusing
- Rectangle : formal
- Pyramid : feel of stability
- Reverse Pyramid ~ V-arrangement : high tension
- Iconic : formal and power
- Cross : formal and power
- Symmetrical : formal and power
- Slide ~ Diagonal : feels dynamic
- Z-arrangement : feels dynamic
- L-arrangement : sense of movement
- radial : sense of movement
- H-arrangement : sense of stability
- Y-arrangement : high tension
- C-arrangement : uneasy feeling
- V-arrangement : high tension
- X-arrangement : high tension, focusing

##### Composition: Balance

- Keep proper balance of primary, secondary and tertiary shapes
- Rule of odds
- Symmetry: avoid unless deliberately aimed
- Avoid same size, number, spacing
- Overlap object to make depth
- Prefer to put small outside and big inside
- Add a standout item

##### Composition: Focal Point ~ Movement Means

- Using contrast
- Using structure
- Using guiding lines
 -- Using circular diagram
 -- Using diagonals
- Using tangents
- Using character's view
- Using overlapping Objects

##### Composition: Attributes

- Balance
- Proportion
- Movement ~ Focal Point
- Rhythm
- Variety / Unity
- Harmony ~ Tactics
- Emphasis ~ Contrast

##### Tangent

...

##### Kind of Tangents

- Object touching another Object
- Object in foreground touching Object in background
- Object in foreground touching Object in background in a straight line
- Two unrelated Objects share the same horizontal or vertical line ( usually dynamic )
- Object touching the edge of the frame
- Object cut down the middle

##### Composition Exercises

- Primary, Secondary And Tertiary Overlays

##### Questions to Evaluate an Art Piece

- Does painting tell a story?
- Is composition as good as it can be?
  - Does it has a dramatic camera angle?
  - Is it balanced?
  - Is everything lead to the focal point?
  - Is contrast okay?
  - Does the eye flow diagram go out of the image accidentally?
  - Flip along the x-axis to check balance is good.
  - Blur to check it is balanced?
- Does it has depth
  - Does the image has several layers?
  - Does the image use dark and light layers composition?
  - Do details up to scale?
- Does it not has perspective mistakes?
- Does not it has accidental tangents?
- Checking Color and Light
  - Is it not too monochromatic?
  - Set saturation to zero to check if it is still good?
  - Use a levels diagram to check does it have enough black blacks and white whites.
- Checking shapes and forms in a painting
  - Does it has interesting shapes?
  - Does it has areas of visual detail and rest?
  - Does it has a proper ratio between primary, secondary, and tertiary shapes?
- Texture Check
  - Does it has more than one material?
  - Do materials look differently?
- Asking for an Opinion
  - Take into account the Ikea effect
- Compare
  - Does it feels as good as the sketch?
  - Does it feels as good as the works of others?
- Does it look as good after a break?
- Does it look as good on all devices you have?
- Technical Tests
  - Flip along the x-axis to check balance is good.
  - Set saturation to zero to check it is still good.
  - Blur to check it is balanced?
  - Use a levels diagram to check does it have enough black blacks and white whites.
