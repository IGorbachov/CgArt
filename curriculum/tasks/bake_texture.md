# Create a chest model
Create a chest model, divide it into low and high models. Add extra geometry to high model and bake it to low

RESTRICTIONS: Models should not have N-gons, overlaping, duplicate vertices or other issues in topology. Try to minimize the number of polygons in the low model

You can use these images for inspiration or find your own.

P.S. You must create your own model, not repeat an existing one
