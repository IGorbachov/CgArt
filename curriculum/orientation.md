# Guidelines for Success

## Mission

Mission is to cultivate **well-trained professionals** who can immediately add value to any team and are equipped with the skills to tackle real-world challenges. Graduates will earn professional certificates, which significantly reduce the risk for companies that might otherwise hire under-prepared individuals. We are here to mentor and guide anyone who needs it.

However, our focus is not on:

- Providing an entertaining experience where participants pretend to be Rust developers.
- Offering just an introductory overview of the subject matter.
- Creating content where ample high-quality resources already exist online.
- Delivering lectures.
- Providing unnecessary hand-holding or 'babysitting.'

These are **non-goals** of the boot camp.

## Practice and Pa—Åe

Remember to **follow along** with the instructor in the video during your lecture sessions. Try not just to replicate their steps, but also to **experiment** and explore variations on the model they demonstrate. Dive into the realm of possibilities and discover what you can create. After the lecture, don't delay - get hands-on and start working on your objectives **immediately**. Postponing practice until after all the videos are watched could hinder your learning progress. To learning **every day**, don't pause learning process for longer than day.

## Efficiency

The amount of time you dedicate to your work is often more crucial than the perfection of the final product. To streamline your workflow, **install Google Drive**. This tool will save you significant time as it eliminates the need to constantly upload or download files. Familiarize yourself with **keyboard shortcuts** to further improve your efficiency.

## Quality and Aesthetics

Aim to produce work of a high standard that's aesthetically pleasing, **ready for production**, and worthy of inclusion in your portfolio. Do not rush through objectives with the sole intention of ticking them off your list. Each piece of work you produce is a reflection of your capabilities, so make sure it's something you're proud of.
